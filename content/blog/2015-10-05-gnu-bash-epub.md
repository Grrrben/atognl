As I could not find a free and opensource Bash manual in the ePub format I decided to convert the PDF version of the Free Software Foundation.<!--more-->

<a href="/images/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GNU_bash.epub" target="_blank">Download Bash Manual in ePub</a>.

The original book is made freely available by the Free Software Foundation and anyone is encouraged to make contributions. So for copyleft&#8217;s sake, take it, improve it, distribute it. There is still some work to do, as I would love to get the table of contents to work properly.

The front cover is based on the o&#8217;Reilly theme and is considered satire, don&#8217;t sue me on this one. If you&#8217;re looking for a PDF version, it can be freely downloaded from  the [GNU][1] website.
